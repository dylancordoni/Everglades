			<h2>What are the Everglades?</h2>
			<p class="description">The Everglades are a two million acre subtropical region in southern Florida that includes a number of various habitats. Swamps, praries, and mangroves are often flooded by overflow from Lake Okeechabee in central Florida which create small flowing rivers that eventually connect to Florida Bay at the states southern most tip. This region is home to many unique species of animals and amphibians that have acclimated to the regions humid environment.</p>

			<h2>A Brief History Lesson</h2>
			<p class="description">The history of the Everglades spans back to its formation over 5,000 years ago. Indigenous populations soon inhabited the surrounding regions, using the Everglades as a ground for fishing, gathering, and hunting, traversing its swampy ecosystem in cypress canoes. These tribes eventually fell victim to imperialism that came with European exploration in the 1700’s. Fast-forwarding to the early 1900’s, the state of Florida began construction that cut off the original flow of the Everglades in order to support agricultural communities. Although Everglades National Park was established in 1979, the slow but steady destruction of its surrounding areas continued until the year 2000 when the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was authorized by the Water Resources Development Act. This plan would restore the original water flow to the Everglades and halt development in the area. </p>
